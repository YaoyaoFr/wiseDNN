    Keras implementation for the wiseDNN for brain disease prognosis

    The code was written by Dr. Mingxia Liu and Dr. Jun Zhang, Department of Radiology at UNC-CH. 

1. Introduction

    We propose a weakly-supervised Densely-connected Neural Network (wiseDNN) for brain disease prognosis using baseline MRI data and incomplete clinical scores. Specifically, we first extract multi-scale image patches (located by anatomical landmarks) from structural MRI to capture local-to-global structural information of images, and then develop a weakly-supervised densely-connected network for task-oriented extraction of imaging features and joint prediction of multiple clinical measures. A weighted loss function is further employed to make full use of all available subjects (even those without ground-truth scores at certain time-points) for network training.
